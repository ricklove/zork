This work was supported by a grant of 37 million\nzorkmids from the Central Bureaucracy and your omnipotent local\ntyrant Lord Dimwit Flathead the Excessive. This impressive\nstructure is composed of 3.7 cubic feet of concrete, is 256 feet\ntall at the center, and 193 feet wide at the top.  The reservoir\ncreated behind the dam has a volume of 37 billion cubic feet, an\narea of 12 million square feet, and a shore line of 36 thousand\nfeet.\n\n  The construction of FCD#3 took 112 days from ground breaking to\nthe dedication. It required a work force of 384 slaves, 34 slave\ndrivers, 12 engineers, 2 turtle doves, and a partridge in a pear\ntree. The work was managed by a command team composed of 2345\nbureaucrats, 2347 secretaries (at least two of which can type),\n12,256 paper shufflers, 52,469 rubber stampers, 245,193 red tape\nprocessors, and nearly one million dead trees.\n\n  We will now point out some of the more interesting features\nof FCD#3 as we conduct you on a guided tour of the facilities:\n	1) You start your tour here in the Dam Lobby.\n	   You will notice on your right that .........")

In particular, the following\nsequence will not work correctly, nor will anything resembling it:\n>take\ntake what?\n>frob\nwhat do you want me to do with it?\n     Note that if you now respond 'take', the right thing will\nhappen. In short, the current parser can't handle verbs with missing\nobjects.  Since it is completely new, we'd appreciate reports of any\nother bugs encountered.\n\nFLASH!\n     An important change has been made.  When you have been killed,\nand the 'patch' question is asked, or if you are confirming a 'quit',\nit is now necessary to terminate the response to the question with a\ncarriage return (you may be surprised to find that this wasn't true\nbefore).  Also, the answer to the 'patch' question is taken to be yes\nunless something starting with n, N, f, or F is typed; the answer to\nthe 'quit' question is no unless something starting with y, Y, t, or\nT is typed.\n\nFLASH!\n     Another FLAG DAY has been declared for save files.  Yes, ladies\nand gentlemen, yet another incompatible change has been made to the\nsave/restore code.  When will it end?\n\n     Things like the bucket should resume working in this version.\n\n     Many people have reported the following message:\n'GIN FREE STORAGE- VECTOR ...GOUT TIME= n.nn'\nThis indicates that a garbage collection is occurring.  Some reports\nhave this taking up to 30 sec. of cpu time, during which your dungeon\nwill refuse to respond.  We have added a feature which should prevent\nthis; if you see such a message, please send mail to DUNGEON@DM\ndescribing the circumstances (particularly number of moves,\nsave/restore status, and the TIME).  A garbage collection is not\nfatal:  your dungeon should be perfectly all right once it finishes\n(after the GOUT TIME= message is printed).")
