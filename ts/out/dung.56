  "     Guide Book to   Flood Control Dam #3    Flood Control Dam #3 (FCD#3) was constructed in year 783 of the Great Underground Empire to harness the destructive power of the Frigid River.  This work was supported by a grant of 37 million zorkmids from the Central Bureaucracy and your omnipotent local tyrant Lord Dimwit Flathead the Excessive. This impressive structure is composed of 3.7 cubic feet of concrete, is 256 feet tall at the center, and 193 feet wide at the top.  The reservoir created behind the dam has a volume of 37 billion cubic feet, an area of 12 million square feet, and a shore line of 36 thousand feet.    The construction of FCD#3 took 112 days from ground breaking to the dedication. It required a work force of 384 slaves, 34 slave drivers, 12 engineers, 2 turtle doves, and a partridge in a pear tree. The work was managed by a command team composed of 2345 bureaucrats, 2347 secretaries (at least two of which can type), 12,256 paper shufflers, 52,469 rubber stampers, 245,193 red tape processors, and nearly one million dead trees.

  "  US NEWS & DUNGEON REPORT 12/12/77             Late Dungeon Edition       In order to get a more-or-less working version, we have installed one with some known bugs.  In particular, the following sequence will not work correctly, nor will anything resembling it: >take take what? >frob what do you want me to do with it?      Note that if you now respond 'take', the right thing will happen. In short, the current parser can't handle verbs with missing objects.  Since it is completely new, we'd appreciate reports of any other bugs encountered.  FLASH!      An important change has been made.  When you have been killed, and the 'patch' question is asked, or if you are confirming a 'quit', it is now necessary to terminate the response to the question with a carriage return (you may be surprised to find that this wasn't true before).  Also, the answer to the 'patch' question is taken to be yes unless something starting with n, N, f, or F is typed; the answer to the 'quit' question is no unless something starting with y, Y, t, or T is typed.  FLASH!      Another FLAG DAY has been declared for save files.  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, yet another incompatible change has been made to the save/restore code.  When will it end?       Things like the bucket should resume working in this version.       Many people have reported the following message: 'GIN FREE STORAGE- VECTOR ...GOUT TIME= n.nn' This indicates that a garbage collection is occurring.  Some reports have this taking up to 30 sec. of cpu time, during which your dungeon will refuse to respond.  We have added a feature which should prevent this; if you see such a message, please send mail to DUNGEON@DM describing the circumstances (particularly number of moves, save/restore status, and the TIME).  A garbage collection is not fatal:  your dungeon should be perfectly all right once it finishes (after the GOUT TIME= message is printed). ");
